# Wangscape - Forest Microclimate & 3D Heterogeneity Research

Welcome to Wangscape, a research initiative dedicated to advancing our understanding of forest microclimate through innovative 3D modeling and remote sensing technologies.

## About Wangscape

Wangscape represents cutting-edge research at the intersection of forest ecology, physics, and computer science. We develop open-source tools and methodologies to quantify and understand the complex three-dimensional nature of forest environments and their microclimate dynamics.
